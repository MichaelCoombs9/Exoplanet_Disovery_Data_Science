# Exoplanet Discovery Project

Hello, I am Michael Coombs, and I am pleased to introduce my latest data science project. This project was completed using Python in Google Colab and the visualization was created in Flourish Studios. To gather the data for this project, I utilized the NASA Exoplanet Archive, which is a reputable source of information.

This is the link to my project where you can find the data visualized in a bar chart race. The chart shows the discovery of exoplanets over the years, and sorts them by their method of discovery.

## Python File

[Python File Here](https://github.com/MichaelCoombs9/Exoplanet_Disovery_Data_Science/blob/main/exoplanet_discovery_data_science_project.py)
This is where you will find the code that I used to manipulate the data which I retrieved from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. I used this code to convert it into a properly formated CSV file which I could use in the Flourish Studio visualization.
